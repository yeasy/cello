# Lesson 1: Prerequisites

## Knowledger Base

Before we get into this tutorial, though not necessary, it would be better if you have a  basic understanding of *Hyperledger Fabric*. You can get more information about it by checking out the [*Key Concepts*](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/key_concepts.html).

You should also have read the [*Concept*](../concepts.md) page, but still, we'll briefly revisit key ideas as they come up.

## Environment

To set up the environment for the following lessons, make sure you have these 3 tools installed on your computer:

1. [*git*](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [*make*](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)
3. [*docker*](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker)

All of them are usually available through package managers.

So far, no compatibility issues have been reported with the versions of these tools. However, if you encounter any problems, feel free to let us know via the [*GitHub*](https://github.com/hyperledger-cello/cello) page.

Now, navigate to the directory where you want to place the project and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-cello/cello
```

If the command runs successfully, switch into the project directory:
```bash
cd cello
```

That's it for this lesson. See you in the next one!
